this is file 1 for understanding git

add content to file 1
    git init -> initializes the current folder as a repo and .git folder 
    this folder now will be seen through source control

    git status -> tells what files are staged,left to be staged etc ....made changes but havent been added
    git add . -> adds all files
    git add file1.txt file2.txt ->multiple files

    git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>  -> rename a branch
    git branch -d <branch-name>


    git merge TEST1 -> this can merge the paralle working in a differnt braanch to our main branch say we fixed a  bug


    -------takes us to staging area

    git commmit -m "message"

    --------commits


BRANCHING AND CONFLICTS
    git branch -> gives list of branches
    git branch "name" -> makes a new branch 

    git switch "name" -> switches to that 
    
    git switch -c "name"  -> will switch if exist ,if no ,THEN CREATE AND THEN switch to that branch

HOW BRANCHING WORKS
    say u have main branch with all your code
    then u made a new branch named TEST1 
    then u created a file2.txt and pushed it

    now your TEST1 branch will have all the code from before + TEST2.txt
    
    so basically each branch inherits all its content from parent and the new content being pushed gets added to the branch
    
    when u switch back to main u wont find those changes
